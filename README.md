What is Ringcoin?
--------------------------------

If you start worrying, it will be too late! Get ready to win a diamond ring worth 6.5 carats right now!?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ringcoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 2.5 ~20 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)
 -  ~7,777,7777total coin
The rest is the same as Bitcoin.
 - 77 coins per block 4 weeks only
 -  to retarge2870000 coin t difficulty
Blocks are being created every day. It is always connected to the node and anyone can participate.
If the value of Ecoins ended at $1 or $2 apiece, I wouldn't have even started. However, we have to evolve into a coin that exceeds the value of Bitcoin someday, and such a virtual currency will appear once.The detailed technical description is almost identical to Litecoin, so please refer to Litecoin. However, this coin will go a different way than Litecoin.Woori Coin will not proceed with any updates that are considered to be updates that may decrease its value. If that is likely, 2 million coins will be pre-mined and issued to override this opinion.A hash value is drawn every month, and a diamond payment event is held. As a result of sufficient skepticism about the diamond payment event, it was judged that it was right to give luck to miners and coin holders, so the person who sold the coin is excluded from the lottery qualification. Therefore, a new hash value is announced through the computer system every month. The probability of getting all the hash values ​​right is extremely low. Therefore, it is judged that there will be no holders for the time being.Gold just says everything by weight and price. Therefore, it is a currency that is used all over the world. Litecoin passed that stage and chose to lower its value on its own. I oppose this tyranny of Litecoin. But its speed and stability deserve credit. Therefore, we launched this coin to develop a fast-speed coin with appropriate value, proving that traditional cryptocurrencies can be suitable for value listing in the Asian market as well as in Europe.If you have an Ecoin, please keep that in mind. If you launch an Ecoin on the market at less than $100 per piece, it will be judged as an act that prevents proper price maintenance, and the claim will be ignored in all developments and updates by tracking the trader. Also, other development achievements for full commercialization and autonomy in the country will never be shared.With this coin, we can create a unique opportunity to change lives. But you may get nothing. But let's think. If you do nothing, you will get nothing in the end. A true victor will seize such an opportunity only when he has the will to make his own path and push through alone, even if everyone else opposes it. An early Bitcoin miner exchanged 24,000 Bitcoins for pizza. I hope you don't make the same mistake with this coin. Even if I mine this coin, I hope to keep half of it. Since 77 are paid, 38.5 can be used for sales and profit redemption. A fool is someone who cashes in and spends everything they have. If you change everything to cash because it's valuable, you will definitely regret it in the future. I have clearly warned you.If anyone wants to buy this coins, even if they cost less than $100 apiece, I hope they don't sell them. And I hope you put it in your wallet and wait for someone who understands even $100 to come along. Because based on the value of this coin, it is also a very low amount. In fact, we plan to airdrop Ecoin at a similar level and have a similar value in the market.

Specially designed 6.5 carat diamond ring event!!!!!

This coin is pre-mined and issued in 2 million units for developers and investors.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Ringcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/ringcoin-project/ringcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Ringcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./ringcoin-qt_test
