What is Ringcoin?
--------------------------------

If you start worrying, it will be too late! Get ready to win a diamond ring worth 6.5 carats right now!?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ringcoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 2.5 ~20 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 7,777,777 coin (~8years)
 -  ~7,777,7777total coin
The rest is the same as Bitcoin.
 - 7.777coins per block
 These coins are intentionally issued with lower denominations to prove that even lower denominations can have value.
 In addition to the coins pre-mined by the manager, if you mine 10 million, these coins will all be self-purchased at $100 each.
 These coins are designed to be linked to 100 USD each, and currently you can receive 770 USD if you succeed in mining once.
 It doesn't mention that it's possible. If 10 million coins are mined by customers and users, the minimum price of this coin is unconditionally fixed at $100 per coin.
 Based on the country where the most coins are mined, recovery will start first, and a separate team will be established to recover these coins.
 Even if less than 10 million are mined, trading is possible, but the coin will have to be registered on the exchange. Individuals can build exchanges. A separate recovery management team has been established to start its own recovery process based on the country that has mined the most coins out of 10 million coins.
 
 -  to retarge2870000 coin t difficultyThis coin is designed so that anyone can mine it with a computer equipped with an environment where vm ware can be installed or a virtual box can be installed.In other words, anyone can mine even if the computer's performance is low.This coin is guaranteed to be transparent. The function for anonymous transactions is not scheduled to be updated in this coin.This coin is guaranteed to be transparent. The function for anonymous transactions is not scheduled to be updated in this coin.If the value of Ecocoin is likely to decrease, it will be excluded from discussion no matter how democratic the process is.
 This coin is currently exempt from government or tax tracking. However, if your coin is listed on an exchange, chances are it will give you a reason to spy on you.
 This coin will be neutral against potentially criminal anonymous transactions. However, all responsibilities for transactions that may be inherently subject to surveillance lie with the parties to the transaction.This coin can be used for drugs, sex and crime, but it will be monitored and it will be conducted under the supervision of government agencies. Although the coin itself has no such function, you should keep in mind that using it for any purpose is at your own risk.
 Replace your salary with eco-coins! In the long run, one of these coins will trade for around $2000-3000. So, if you replace your salary with these coins, your employees will prefer these coins to cash. Even if it is not worth it right away, the perception of the welfare of the company that is paid will change to a level that is recognized. do.If you cope with the salary increase with this coin, you will be reborn as a more advanced company. It should be noted that this coin will continue to increase in value. Therefore, receiving a certain amount of these coins along with cash will be a very beneficial gift for employees.Try paying these coins in exchange for sex. This one coin will be worth more than you can buy with just one sex. Therefore, if this coin is paid to a woman of the opposite sex or prostitution in exchange for sex, she will prefer to receive this coin in exchange for the purpose of enormous wealth in the future.
 Use this coin at weddings and weddings! This coin will replace the function of all currencies in the long term. Therefore, this coin will be more valuable as a valuable gift than a diamond ring.
 
 Also, 50 coins was too many. In order to have sufficient value and give more people a chance to obtain the hash value, fewer coins than 50 coins must be paid. This coin will be designed with a direction for that reason and will have a higher value. For example, the price per light coin is around $100, but we expect that our coin will stably settle down to at least $2,000-3,000.
 
 Litecoin was issued in quantity of 50. As a result of the test, the people who exclusively mined this coin for the first week probably became opportunists with enormous wealth. According to the results of testing Litecoin in practice, the first 50 units would have been enough for the initial miners to monopolize the supply and build wealth. Our coin is designed to take more time and effort for first-time miners to monopolize wealth.
 
 Right now, you might think that this coin has no value. However, Bitcoin has broken that perception in 10 years and has grown into a new commodity. This coin will not only replace the function of currency, but will grow into an excellent auxiliary means as a means of payment for jewelry, salaries, and labor.
 Because it has a substitute function for cash. For example, if you have this coin on your computer at the airport, it will not be subject to tax and will not be subject to inquiry. No matter where you travel in the world with this coin, no one knows yet how much this coin is worth.
 In all entertainment venues with parties, sex, and drinking, these coins will be more precious and valuable. These coins will replace your alcohol bill and will be paid for the labor you provide. This coin is one of the most excellent choices for all the functions that cash performs and for payment for anything with value. 77777777 of these coins are issued. How many houses are there in the world? It's great to have this one coin in its entirety. This coin is expected to rise enough to match the average house price worldwide. If we have normal value, continuously update and develop technology and infrastructure, our coin has the potential to grow more than Bitcoin in the future.You won't believe this right now and no one will think easily. I hope you understand why we are not issuing more of these coins. This coin is not intended to be a speculative coin on the exchange. However, in the long run, this coin is far less risky than futures on exchanges or other coins that are extremely undervalued. Remember that only 7.7 are issued.
 
 
 
 
Blocks are being created every day. It is always connected to the node and anyone can participate.
If the value of coins ended at $1 or $2 apiece, I wouldn't have even started. However, we have to evolve into a coin that exceeds the value of Bitcoin someday, and such a virtual currency will appear once.The detailed technical description is almost identical to Litecoin, so please refer to Litecoin. However, this coin will go a different way than Litecoin.Woori Coin will not proceed with any updates that are considered to be updates that may decrease its value. If that is likely,4 million coins will be pre-mined and issued to override this opinion.A hash value is drawn every month, and a diamond payment event is held. As a result of sufficient skepticism about the diamond payment event, it was judged that it was right to give luck to miners and coin holders, so the person who sold the coin is excluded from the lottery qualification. Therefore, a new hash value is announced through the computer system every month. The probability of getting all the hash values ​​right is extremely low. Therefore, it is judged that there will be no holders for the time being.Gold just says everything by weight and price. Therefore, it is a currency that is used all over the world. Litecoin passed that stage and chose to lower its value on its own. I oppose this tyranny of Litecoin. But its speed and stability deserve credit. Therefore, we launched this coin to develop a fast-speed coin with appropriate value, proving that traditional cryptocurrencies can be suitable for value listing in the Asian market as well as in Europe.If you have an Ecoin, please keep that in mind. If you launch an Ecoin on the market at less than $100 per piece, it will be judged as an act that prevents proper price maintenance, and the claim will be ignored in all developments and updates by tracking the trader. Also, other development achievements for full commercialization and autonomy in the country will never be shared.With this coin, we can create a unique opportunity to change lives. But you may get nothing. But let's think. If you do nothing, you will get nothing in the end. A true victor will seize such an opportunity only when he has the will to make his own path and push through alone, even if everyone else opposes it. An early Bitcoin miner exchanged 24,000 Bitcoins for pizza. I hope you don't make the same mistake with this coin. Even if I mine this coin, I hope to keep half of it. Since 77 are paid, 38.5 can be used for sales and profit redemption. A fool is someone who cashes in and spends everything they have. If you change everything to cash because it's valuable, you will definitely regret it in the future. I have clearly warned you.If anyone wants to buy this coins, even if they cost less than $100 apiece, I hope they don't sell them. And I hope you put it in your wallet and wait for someone who understands even $100 to come along. Because based on the value of this coin, it is also a very low amount. In fact, we plan to airdrop Ecoin at a similar level and have a similar value in the market.

The pre-issuance amount of Ecoin is used for the following purposes.
Remuneration for development team
1st and 2nd Public Investor Recruitment
Office and server maintenance
Prevention of price fluctuations through self-purchase and distribution volume control
Discovering and investing in the aerospace industry and space companies
Discovery of future strategic companies and technology improvement of virtual currency
The pre-issuance quantity is about 4 million, and it is not for personal use.
This coin is designed to control the initial issuance so that a small number of users cannot monopolize too many coins in the beginning.

Specially designed 6.5 carat diamond ring event!!!!!

Start time: When the first 1000 node users break through Draw date: Currently undecided. Scheduled to be paid when a specific quantity is mined or purchased on the exchange.

The power of our coin will provide you with the highest quality luxury house, a nice car and a luxurious and leisurely life. However, you should look at at least 10 years and invest in this coin. This coin is reserved for 2 million coins to control trading for speculative purposes for short-term investments.

This coin is pre-mined and issued in 2.8 million units for developers and investors.
The remaining coins are held for the purpose of self-recovery and commercial investment to return the profits to coin holders, and personal use is strictly restricted. In addition, usage history can be tracked and monitored by anyone, even for just one coin.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Ringcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/ringcoin-project/ringcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Ringcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:
